# MicroprocessorsII-Lab2-UML
Lab designed to control the game "snake". Snake moves in four directions: up, down, left, and right. It grows its length by one unit every time an apple is eaten and the player earns 10 points. Snake cannot hit the boundary of the arena. Game is initially controlled with keys on the keyboard and the goal is to implement a joystick to control the movement of the snake, use a gyro sensor to control movement of the snake, and implement a buzzer to beep when an apple is eaten. This lab uses python3 and C/C++ programming.
